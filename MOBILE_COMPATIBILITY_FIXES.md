# Mobile Compatibility Fixes for Video Playback

## Problem Analysis

The "Video unavailable" error on mobile browsers was caused by several issues:

1. **Autoplay Restrictions**: Mobile browsers block autoplay by default
2. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper error handling for YouTube player failures
3. **Incomplete Mobile Parameters**: Missing mobile-specific YouTube player parameters
4. **No Fallback Mechanism**: No alternative when videos can't be embedded

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Mobile Device Detection and Autoplay Handling

```javascript
// Detect mobile device
const isMobile = /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent);

// Disable autoplay on mobile
'autoplay': isMobile ? 0 : 1
```

### 2. Enhanced YouTube Player Configuration

Added mobile-optimized parameters:
- `playsinline: 1` - Prevents fullscreen on mobile
- `fs: 1` - Allows fullscreen when needed
- `cc_load_policy: 0` - Disables captions by default
- `iv_load_policy: 3` - Hides video annotations
- `enablejsapi: 1` - Enables JavaScript API
- `origin: window.location.origin` - Sets origin for security

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling

Added `onError` event handler with specific error codes:
- **Error 2**: Invalid video ID
- **Error 5**: HTML5 player error
- **Error 100**: Video not found or private
- **Error 101**: Video not allowed in embedded players
- **Error 150**: Video not allowed in embedded players

### 4. Mobile Play Button Overlay

For mobile devices, shows a play button overlay when the player is ready:
- Appears when autoplay is blocked
- Allows manual playback initiation
- Automatically hides when video starts playing

### 5. Fallback for Embedding Errors

When videos can't be embedded (errors 101, 150):
- Shows a user-friendly error message
- Provides a "Watch on YouTube" button
- Opens the video in a new tab on YouTube

### 6. Improved Loading States

Enhanced loading placeholder management:
- Shows loading state during video loading
- Hides when video is ready or cued
- Better visual feedback for users

- Error frequency by browser/device
- User interaction patterns

This will help identify and resolve future mobile compatibility issues.
